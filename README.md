"General method for constructing local-hidden-state (and -variable) models for multiqubit entangled states"
Daniel Cavalcanti, Leonardo Guerini, Rafael Rabelo and Paul Skrzypczyk

All files are MATLAB data files (.mat) and contain the example states which are entangled but have LHS models (either for projective measurements or for POVMs).

In total there are 8 data files:

1. examples1SFIXROB.mat
2. examples1SGENROB.mat
3. examples1SRANROB.mat
4. examplesGENROB.mat
5. examplesRANROB.mat
6. examplesBSA.mat
7. examplesNEG.mat
8. examplesPOVM.mat

The first seven sets contain the examples found by from quantitative entanglement witnesses (with quantifier corresponding to the name), and contain examples which are local for all projective measurements. The last set contains the examples found which are local for all POVM measurements (using a random choice of quantatative entanglement witness).
